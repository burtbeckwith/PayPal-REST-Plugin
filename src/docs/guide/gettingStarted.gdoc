To use the plugin you need to go create a developers account at [PayPal|http://developer.paypal.com], and a PayPal business account.  On the developers site you will be able to create as many apps as you need, as well as making test accounts.  Once you make your developers account, you will need to get your clientId and secret.

The plugin consists of POGOs that represent all PayPal's data structures and one Grails service.  The POGO's include two main classes that represent a payment request and response, a Payable and Orderable interfaces that you can implement in your own objects that will allow you to collect payment on said object, as well as a set of exceptions for each error response you can receive.

The Grails service at the center of the plugin abstracts away the building of the payment request object also.  Each POGO can still be used separately of the service, but using the service is recommended.  The service consists of three methods that allow you to create a PayPal payment, execute an already created PayPal payment, and execute a credit card payment.

Last but not least, there are two static objects.  One that stores the clientId, secret, and mode (sandbox or live) for the PayPal operations.  The other stores Payable objects to facilitate temporary persistence during redirects to and from PayPal.
